						Hi, I'm Orcun. My journey into AI began with a Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering, sparking a passion that led me to pursue a Master's in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at Sapienza University of Rome.  I've always been driven by the challenge of solving complex problems, and AI provides the perfect tools.  My goal is to contribute meaningfully to the field, whether through research or by joining a dynamic team.
					</p>
					<p>
						During my master's, I explored machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. My thesis focused on optimizing 3D point cloud understanding using the CrossPoint self-supervised learning architecture – a leading architecture in the field. This work received top marks and demonstrated significant potential.  Since then, I've continued to build my skills through personal projects, research, and relevant certifications, focusing on implementing large language models, automating workflows, and deploying AI solutions in the cloud.

						Hi, my name is Orcun. I began my academic journey with a bachelor’s degree in <strong>Mechatronics
						Engineering</strong>, where I first discovered my passion for artificial intelligence. This
						interest inspired me to pivot towards AI and pursue a master’s degree in <strong>Artificial
						Intelligence and Robotics</strong> at Sapienza University of Rome.
					</p>

					<p>
						During my master’s studies, I worked on various areas within AI, including <strong>machine
						learning</strong>, <strong>computer vision</strong>, <strong>natural language
						processing</strong>, and <strong>reinforcement learning</strong>. My thesis focused on
						<strong>optimizing 3D point cloud understanding</strong> using a leading <strong>self-supervised
						learning</strong> architecture. This work earned <strong>top marks</strong> and was highly
						regarded by my academic committee, reflecting its potential for further exploration or publication.
					</p>

					<p>
						While my experience has mainly been through academic and personal projects, I’ve built a strong
						foundation by solving real-world problems, reading research papers, and keeping up with the latest
						developments in AI. My projects have included implementing <strong>large language models
						(LLMs)</strong>, <strong>automating workflows</strong>, deploying AI solutions in the cloud, and
						earning certifications to expand my technical expertise.
					</p>

					<p>
						My journey hasn’t been linear, but every challenge has strengthened my commitment to contribute to
						the future of AI. I’m now looking to dive deeper into AI research, whether through a PhD or by
						joining a research-driven team.

							<p>
								In my master's thesis, I focused on advancing the performance of
								<strong>state-of-the-art</strong> (SOTA) <strong>self-supervised learning</strong> (SSL)
								techniques for 3D point cloud understanding. 3D point clouds, which capture the geometry
								and spatial arrangement of objects, are pivotal in domains such as robotics, augmented
								reality, and autonomous driving. However, their irregular structure, inherent noise, and
								the scarcity of labeled data present significant challenges for traditional supervised
								learning approaches. My research leveraged SSL to mitigate these limitations by enabling
								models to learn more effectively from unlabeled 3D data, reducing dependency on costly
								annotations. <br></br>

								The cornerstone of my work was the optimization of <strong>CrossPoint</strong>, a
								leading <strong>cross-modal contrastive learning</strong> architecture. CrossPoint
								utilizes both <strong>3D point clouds</strong> and their corresponding <strong>2D image
									representations</strong> to improve feature extraction and representation learning.
								This architecture integrates <strong>Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural
									Networks</strong> (DGCNN) for 3D data and <strong>Residual Networks</strong>
								(ResNet) for 2D data, aligning features across modalities to leverage their
								complementary strengths. Building upon this foundation, I incorporated <strong>VICReg
									(Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization)</strong>, a robust SSL framework
								that enhances embedding stability by preserving variance, reducing redundancy, and
								preventing collapse in joint embeddings.<br></br>

								Through rigorous experimentation, I optimized this hybrid approach and evaluated it on
								three key downstream tasks: <strong>3D Object Classification</strong>, <strong>Few-Shot
									Object Classification</strong>, and <strong>3D Object Part Segmentation</strong>.
								Using benchmark datasets such as ShapeNet, ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and ShapeNetPart,
								my modifications to the CrossPoint architecture and integration with VICReg demonstrated
								notable <strong>performance improvements</strong>. These enhancements included
								<strong>better generalization</strong> to unseen data and superior robustness to domain
								shifts, marking a significant step forward in point cloud analysis. For more detailed
								results and analysis, please refer to my full thesis linked below.<br></br>

								This research exemplifies how augmenting cutting-edge architectures like CrossPoint with
								advanced regularization frameworks such as VICReg can enable scalable and efficient AI
								systems. These findings hold promising implications for real-world applications, from
								autonomous navigation to 3D content generation, where labeled data scarcity and domain
								adaptation are persistent hurdles.
